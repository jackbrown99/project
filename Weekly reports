Week 4 
Installed package titled 'learnr'. However, discovered this package was unsatisfactory as to what I was looking for. 
UK Biobank application had to have a case escalation at the request of my supervisor due to exorbitant pricing for data collected. 
Began practising saving items from R into Github, albeit this process was confusing to me I have it figured out now and will be using this to upload furture weekly reports including this one. 
Continued researching how to use R, mainly using the online available for free source, The Big Book of R but also looked for further material.

I tooka library book out on load titled Exploratory Data Analysis Using R by Ronald K. Pearson, this book contains a wealth of information regarding the direction my project will be heading from initial data exploration to model building
